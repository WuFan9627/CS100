# Assignment 2 -- Writing a Basic Command Shell

## Overview
Rshell allows the user to type in shell script commands. With the connectors such as '&&','||'and ';', users can chain multiple commands together. Besides, '#' is used for comment.'echo' is used to print out the users' input, and 'exit' can stop the process any time.

## Bug report
Cannot exit in multiple commands, only works in a single command(fixed)

Cannot execute the command after '&&'even if the former one is executed(fixed)

Cannot handle 'echo #' command(fixed)
